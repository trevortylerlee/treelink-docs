title: Deploy Your Site
description: Deploy your site to Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any other static hosting provider.

To deploy your site means to make it available to the public. You'll be able to share your site with others, and you'll be able to access it from anywhere.

Deploying your Treelink site is that same as deploying any other static Astro site. You can see their deploy guide [here](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/).

### Prerequisites

- **Treelink site** - You'll need to have a Treelink site. If you haven't made one yet, follow the [Quick Start guide](/guides/quick-start).
- **Static hosting provider** - You'll need to have a static hosting provider. You can use [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), [Netlify](https://netlify.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), or any other provider.
- **GitHub account** - You'll need to have a GitHub account. If you don't have one, you can create one [here](https://github.com/join).
- **Optional: Domain name** - You can use a domain name to access your site. If you don't have one, you can rent one from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/), [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/), or any other domain name provider.
